### **Gantt Chart: GolfBot-Prototype Development**  
**Total Timeline**: 13 weeks (91 days)  
**Final Competition**: Week 13  

| **Phase**                     | **Duration**      | **Key Tasks**                                                                 |  
|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **1. Project Initiation & Planning** | **Weeks 1–2**   | - Define competition goals/rules. <br> - Assemble team and assign roles. <br> - Research existing solutions (e.g., LEGO Mindstorm EV3 projects). <br> - Draft initial mechanical/software requirements. |  
| **2. Conceptual Design**          | **Weeks 3–5**   | - Brainstorm robot mechanisms (scooping, navigation). <br> - Sketch CAD models for chassis/actuators. <br> - Plan software architecture (object detection, pathfinding). <br> - Select sensors (color, ultrasonic, gyro). |  
| **3. Hardware Prototyping**       | **Weeks 6–8**   | - Build initial chassis with LEGO Mindstorm. <br> - Integrate motors, USB camera, and custom sensors. <br> - Test basic locomotion and obstacle avoidance. <br> - Refine ball-collection mechanism (scoop/conveyor). |  
| **4. Software Development**       | **Weeks 6–10**  | - Code VIP ball detection (color recognition). <br> - Develop pathfinding algorithm (A*/Dijkstra). <br> - Implement scoring logic (prioritize Goal A, avoid penalties). <br> - Integrate sensor feedback (edge detection, collision avoidance). |  
| **5. Integration & Testing**      | **Weeks 9–12**  | - **Alpha Testing (Weeks 9–10)**: Basic autonomy (collect 5+ balls). <br> - **Beta Testing (Weeks 11–12)**: Full autonomy (11 balls, VIP priority). <br> - Optimize speed vs. accuracy. <br> - Validate scoring system (simulate penalties). |  
| **6. Pre-Competition Prep**       | **Week 13**     | - Final calibration (camera, sensors). <br> - Mock competition runs. <br> - Document test videos and code. <br> - Buffer time for last-minute fixes. |  
| **7. Competition & Review**       | **Day 91**      | - Execute competition run. <br> - Submit video documentation. <br> - Post-mortem analysis. |

### **Key Milestones**  
- **Week 2**: Finalized project plan and team roles.  
- **Week 5**: Approved mechanical/software design.  
- **Week 8**: Functional hardware prototype.  
- **Week 10**: Core software complete (ball detection, pathfinding).  
- **Week 12**: Robot reliably collects all 11 balls under 8 minutes.  
- **Week 13**: Robot optimized for maximum scoring (VIP first, Goal A focus).  

---

### **Parallel Workflows**  
- **Hardware/Software Overlap**:  
  - Weeks 6–8: Hardware prototyping while software team begins ball-detection coding.  
  - Weeks 9–10: Integration of sensors with navigation algorithms.  
- **Testing Iterations**:  
  - Weekly testing sprints from Week 6 onward (e.g., locomotion tests → edge detection → VIP prioritization).  

---

### **Risk Mitigation**  
1. **Hardware Delays**: Allocate Weeks 8–9 for redesigning faulty components (e.g., jammed scoop).  
2. **Software Bugs**: Use Weeks 10–11 for debugging pathfinding logic.  
3. **Sensor Calibration**: Reserve Week 12 for fine-tuning camera/color recognition.

### **Notes**  
- **Documentation**: Maintain logs for design changes, test results, and code versions.  
- **Mock Competitions**: Simulate edge cases (e.g., VIP ball placement near edges, varying obstacle positions).  
- **Team Coordination**: Weekly sync meetings to align hardware/software progress.  

This extended timeline allows for iterative refinement of both hardware and software, ensuring reliability and maximizing competition points. Adjust based on prototyping complexity and team capacity.
